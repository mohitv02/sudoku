Our project is solving sudoku with different AI algorithms. We have made this solver in python . So first of all run this python file.
After that it will show the sudoku . 
Then if we press "B" then it will backtrack algorithm.
     if we press "E" then it will show the exhaustive search algorithm.
     if we press "C" then it will show the csp algorithm.
     if we press "M" then it will show the modified csp algorithm which contains extra heuristics
     if we press "G" then it will show the genetic algorithm.
     If we press "R" then the grid will get reset to initial unsolved sudoku
